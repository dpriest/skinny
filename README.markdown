Skinny 
======

Skinny is a simple application to build lists. 
It is coded with [symfony](http://www.symfony-project.org/).

You can see it online at [http://listandcheck.com](http://listandcheck.com).

Installation
------------

Skinny is a symfony application. You can clone its repository by doing
  
  git clone git://github.com/nacmartin/skinny.git

and then configure your database with:

  vim config/databases.yml

After that, you can proceed as usual with symfony.

It contains code from [symfonians](http://symfonians.org) and [symfony-check](http://symfony-check.org/). Its design obviously comes from symfony-check.

Skinny is open sourced to give ideas for projects using symfony. Although, of course, you can use the code for whatever you want if you respect the license.

Postscript

In case you are curious, Skinny is a character of Breaking Bad (I name projects after BB characters).
